Great, now we've created the projects controller we want to create a Project model so we can store projects in the database. 

Run: 
rails g model project name:string description:text target_pledge_amount:decimal

This creates the model for a database table with the fields Name, Description and Target Pledge Amount. They also have corresponding types such as string, text and decimal. 

Once we run:

rake db:migrate we now have a database.
