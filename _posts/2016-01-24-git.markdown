Now, that the first little chunk of code is done lets put it on GIthub.

  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"

On github.io Create new repo
Grab code from new repo:
  
  git remote add origin https://github.com/oschebell/crowdfund.git
  git push -u origin master

Done!
