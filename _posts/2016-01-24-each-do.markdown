Cool so that lists the projects as a hash but if we want to display it as say a list we can use the ruby .each do method to iterate through the hash and pull the content out for each project. It would look like this:

<% @projects.each do |project| %>
    <li><%= project %></li>
<% end %>


How does this work???

Well, it calls the .each method on the @projects instance variable. It then assigns the first item in the hash to the variable inside the pipe characters |project| 
it then creates a HTML list item <li> and then calls the project variable which displays the current hash item. Like so.

hash from projects controller:     @projects = ['Electric Skateboard', 'Meat Popsicle', 'Waterproof Teabag']

index.html.erb:

<ul>
<% @projects.each do |project| %>
<li ><%= project %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>

The outputted html:


    Electric Skateboard
    Meat Popsicle
    Waterproof Teabag
